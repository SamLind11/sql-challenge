# SQL Challenge

This repository was created for Challenge 9 of the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## Challenge Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with organizing and querying a fictional company's employee database, provided in the form of 6 csv files.  I first inspected the files in order to create an Entity Relational Diagram (pictured below), which was created using [quickdatabasediagram.com](quickdatabasediagram.com).  I then used this to create 6 tables in a SQL database, defining primary and foreign keys for each.  Finally, using queries contained in the file "data_analysis.sql", I solved 8 problems regarding details of the database.

## Deliverables
- **schema.sql**: Creates the 6 tables used to store the csv data.
- **data_analysis.sql**: Contains queries to answer the 8 data analysis questions.
- **Employee_ERD.png**: Entity Relationship Diagram for the employee database.

## Authorship
The six CSV files were provided by the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.  All SQL files were written by Sam Lind.
